[Sequel](https://sequel.jeremyevans.net/) has very pretty and clear documentation, so this post isn't as much about explaining what it does (offering "a concise DSL for constructing SQL queries and table schemas") and how it does it (nicely, "with adapters for ADO, Amalgalite, IBM_DB, JDBC, MySQL, Mysql2, ODBC, Oracle, PostgreSQL, SQLAnywhere, SQLite3, TinyTDS, and Trilogy"), as it is about noting that it exists, allowing me to remember it, providing the above link if by chance someone stumbled here before having visited there, and... well, this is a pretty nice tool for database manipulation in the Ruby space.
