You can start with a funny (to you) ["how to write a how-to how-to"](/docs/2025/11/15/how-to-how-to/), but you better get serious soon!

Writing a pseudo-philosophical mini-essay about [what requires documentation][what] may get you one step closer to doing actual documentation work, but only because you yourself need these steps to get there!

Your articles about [useful ruby tools][ruby-tools] are also useful steps, as you're progressively getting the hang of addressing someone to talk about technical things. But I presume that you'll need to get yourself, the first person singular, out of the equation before you start playing in the right ball park. Blogs have a function too. Documentation shall be more, if not entirely, impersonal.
