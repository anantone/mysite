In very early stages, Odysseus (working title) is a prototype story building app. It allows a user to sort and order scenes, adding custom metadata to keep track of specific aspects (characters, places, etc.), include scene text and writing notes, and export the result as an organized text document. It can be experimented with at [https://story.anant1.net/](https://story.anant1.net/).

As will be obvious, this is nowhere near any letter of the Greek alphabet. Discussion and contributions are welcome, though, on Codeberg: [https://codeberg.org/anantone/odysseus](https://codeberg.org/anantone/odysseus)
