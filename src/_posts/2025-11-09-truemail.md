[Truemail](https://truemail-rb.org/truemail-gem/#) is a Ruby gem that verifies email addresses via Regex, DNS, SMTP, and more, to make sure an email address _exists_ and _is valid_. 

At its most basic, it is extremely simple to use. (Note that providing the verifier's — your — email is required before it will do what you ask.)

```ruby
require 'truemail'

Truemail.configure do |config|
  config.verifier_email = 'verifier@example.com'
end

Truemail.validate('email@example.com') 
# => returns Truemail::Validator instance
Truemail.valid?('email@example.com')   
# => returns Boolean
```

One obvious use case is if you have people sign up for a newsletter or otherwise use email to register on your app/blog/forum, you can integrate the above verification easily and filter out a large part of the fake addresses that you're bound to encounter.

Personally, I was just wondering a few days ago whether this would be easy to do, as I will sometimes contact someone by figuring out the email format used by their organization (first_name.last_name@my_company.com, for instance), which usually works but why not check for exceptions? One could even write a script to try automatically a number of such standard formats until getting the right one. Could that ever be useful, while remaining ethical? You tell me.
